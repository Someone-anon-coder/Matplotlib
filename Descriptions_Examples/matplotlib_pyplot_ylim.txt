ylim function of the matplotlib.pyplot module
This function creates a limit for data points on the axes

This function is used to zoom in to the plot to focus on the data points in the plot

Example:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.ylim([4, 2])

plt.savefig("Plots/fig_with_ylim.png")

Output: Plots/fig_with_ylim.png

This program plots data points x and y. The ylim sets a limit on points between 4 and 2 to zoom in on the plot
