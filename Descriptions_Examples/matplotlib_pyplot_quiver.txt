quiver function of the matplotlib.pyplot module
This function is used to plot vectors and magnitude of data 

This function is useful to plot electromagnetic fields, fluid dynamics

Example:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
y = x[::-1]
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

U = -Y
V = X

plt.quiver(x, y, U, V)

plt.savefig("Plots/quiver_plot.png")
plt.clf()

Output: Plots/quiver_plot.png

This program creates data point x from 1 to 10 and y as function of reverse of x.
This program creates a tuple of coordinates of x and y. The U and V are vectors for -Y and X data.
This program plots quiver plot with x, y, U and V. This program saves the figure and clears the plot

The parameter color defines the color of the lines to show direction and magnitude of data points

Example: 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(1, 10, 20)
y = np.linspace(1, 10, 20)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

U = np.sin(X) * np.cos(Y)
V = np.cos(X) * np.sin(Y)

plt.quiver(X, Y, U, V, color='r')

plt.savefig("Plots/quiver_plot_meshgrid.png")
plt.clf()

Output: Plots/quiver_plot_meshgrid.png

This program creates linear data points x and y from 1 to 10 with 20 elements. This program creates U as 'sin(x)*cos(y)' and V as 'cos(x)*sin(y)'.
This program plots quiver plot with x, y, U, V with red color arrows. The program saves the figure and clears the plot
