add_subplot function of the matplotlib.pyplot.figure module
This function is used to get a axes object to manipulate plots on the figure

This function is useful to create non-linear custom size plots on the figure

Example:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.gridspec as gridspec

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y1 = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
y2 = [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]
y3 = x[::-1]

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
gs = gridspec.GridSpec(2, 2)

ax1 = fig.add_subplot(gs[0, :])
ax2 = fig.add_subplot(gs[1, 0])
ax3 = fig.add_subplot(gs[1, 1])

ax1.plot(x, y1)
ax2.plot(x, y2)
ax3.plot(x, y3)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig("Plots/figure.png")

# Output: Plots/figure.png

In this program a figure of 8 by 6 size and a grid with 2 rows and 2 rows is created. The first plot is plotted on the entire 1st row.
The second plot is plotted on the second row first coloum and third plot on second row second coloum and figure is saved
