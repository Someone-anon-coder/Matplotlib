The plot_wireframe function of the matplotlib.pyplot module.
This function is used to plot 3D wireframes.

This function is useful to plot data to visualize edges of the functions but not the data respresenting the surface

Example:
x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 50)
y = np.linspace(-5, 5, 50)

X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

Z = np.sin(np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2))

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

ax.plot_wireframe(X, Y, Z, color='blue')

plt.savefig("Plots/3d_wireframe_plot.png")
plt.clf()

Output: Plots/3d_wireframe_plot.png

This program creates arrays with x and y with data between -5 and 5 with 50 elements. This program plots the data in a subplot with '3d' projection.
This data is plotted as a wireframe with 'blue' color. This program saves the figure and clears the figure
