linspace function of the numpy library
This function is used to create arrays of numbers

The linspace function is useful to get a range of numbers from start to end, inclusive of the end
The end can be excluded if needed

Example: 
import numpy

print(numpy.linspace(1, 10, 20))

Output: 
1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, 10.0

The linspace gets start as '1' and end as '10' and '20' steps in between
